# TryHackMe – Fundamentals (Refresh & Methodology)

## Scope
This repository documents a structured refresh of core cybersecurity
fundamentals through hands-on labs, with a focus on methodology,
reasoning, and operational habits rather than basic concepts.

## Topics reviewed
- Linux environment enumeration
- User and permission context analysis
- Command-line efficiency in security workflows

## Key takeaways
- Initial access and privilege escalation are won during enumeration,
  not exploitation.
- Small misconfigurations compound into real attack paths.
- Speed comes from structure, not from tools.

## Methodology reinforced
- Always identify execution context (user, groups, privileges)
- Enumerate before acting
- Validate assumptions with the system, not intuition

## Perspective
These labs serve as a practical consolidation of previously acquired
knowledge, with an emphasis on discipline, repeatability, and clarity
of reasoning under realistic conditions.
